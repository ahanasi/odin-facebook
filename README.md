A Facebook clone built as part of the Odin Project Ruby on Rails [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project). 

Farcebook contains some of the platform's core features – users, profiles, "friending," posts, a news feed, and "liking." It uses Devise as the user authentication solution and OmniAuth to provide sign-in with Google. Additional features include the ability to send Welcome / Password-Reset emails via the SendGrid add-on and allow user avatar / post images upload through Rails Active Storage.
